This is file serves as a blueprint to a setup involving promethus/ node-exporter/ mangodb/ mango-exporter/ grafana in order to monitor a MERN application 
(idk why the MERN part isn't workin didn't want to bother the rest is working fine)
Please let me know if you find a fix to the MERN part
The config is standard and aim to be flexible, i will add loki later and the alert manager
As i prefer working with python it will be the next step trying to adapt it that tech



PS : this is a project to learn this stack be nice pls and let me know what i can improve
