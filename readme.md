üöÄ How It All Works Together

Node.js app runs and writes logs locally.

Promtail reads those logs and ships them to Loki.

MongoDB Exporter exposes MongoDB performance metrics on a /metrics endpoint.

Node Exporter exposes system-level metrics.

Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics from both exporters.

Grafana connects to both Prometheus (metrics) and Loki (logs) to visualize everything.

‚öôÔ∏è Components Explained
üü¢ Grafana

Role: Visualization and dashboard tool.

Function: Displays metrics (from Prometheus) and logs (from Loki) in real time.

Why it‚Äôs used: To monitor system health, app performance, and logs in one unified interface.

üîµ Prometheus

Role: Metrics collection and storage system.

Function: Scrapes metrics from exporters and stores them in a time-series database.

Data Sources: Node Exporter (system metrics), Mongo Exporter (database metrics), and possibly your backend app (custom metrics).

üü£ Loki

Role: Centralized log aggregation system.

Function: Stores and indexes logs from different services, but doesn‚Äôt parse them as heavily as ElasticSearch.

Why it‚Äôs used: Lightweight and integrates perfectly with Grafana.

üü° Promtail

Role: Log collector for Loki.

Function: Tails log files from containers or the host system and sends them to Loki.

Where it runs: On the same machine as your services.

üü† MongoDB

Role: Database used by your application.

Function: Stores application data (users, posts, logs, etc.).

Why included: The app data itself is monitored and logged through the exporters.

üî¥ MongoDB Exporter

Role: Provides MongoDB performance metrics to Prometheus.

Examples of metrics:

Connections count

Query performance

Memory usage

Why it‚Äôs used: To monitor the health and performance of your MongoDB instance.

‚ö´ Node Exporter

Role: Collects system-level metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network) from the host machine.

Function: Prometheus scrapes these metrics to monitor infrastructure health.

Why it‚Äôs used: Helps detect resource bottlenecks or hardware issues.




üß∞ Additional Required Tools

| Tool                        | Purpose                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker**                  | Runs each service in isolated containers.                                |
| **Docker Compose**          | Orchestrates all containers easily using one `docker-compose.yaml` file. |
| **Node.js (Optional)**      | If your app backend is built in JavaScript/TypeScript.                   |
| **cAdvisor (Optional)**     | To monitor container resource usage.                                     |
| **Alertmanager (Optional)** | For sending alerts based on Prometheus rules.                            |






This is file serves as a blueprint to a setup involving promethus/ node-exporter/ mangodb/ mango-exporter/ grafana in order to monitor a MERN application 
(idk why the MERN part isn't workin didn't want to bother the rest is working fine)
Please let me know if you find a fix to the MERN part
The config is standard and aim to be flexible, i will add loki later and the alert manager
As i prefer working with python it will be the next step trying to adapt it that tech



PS : this is a project to learn this stack be nice pls and let me know what i can improve
